# RuneEditor

This is a small and lightweight software for writing texts using the Elder and Younger Futhark runes. It is the first version and I will add to and improve it if there is a need for it. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.

If you using this Tool for writing racistic and hatred manuscripts. Go fuck yourself and feel proud for being an asshole.

## Manual:

To use the Tool download the Release_x.y.zip file, unzip the folder which is inside and run the .exe file( yea that simple ;) ).

The Programm is compiled for Windows. If you want to use it on Linux use the current Qt 5.11 Version and compile it yourself(Feel free to contact me if you got problems with it). 

## Features:

* Write text in elder and younger Furtark
* Translate latin Texts into Runes
* Edit the config file for changing the mapping
